<h2>What is 4K?</h2>

<p>
    You must understand what 480, 720, and 1080 is because 4K is basically 2160.
  
  A TV/device that is in 480 can output output video at a horizontal resolution of 480 lines. 
  This means the TV can output 480 lines of scan resolution, so obviously the more you have the better
  picture you will get.  Older CRT TV's and a picture considered standard definition is normally 480P/i or lower, and it
  normally has an aspect ratio of 4:3(square picture just like the older TV's).  The number such as 480 refers to the number
  of pixels, so a tv with 480 pixels can have around 640(width) x 480(length) pixels on a screen with an aspect
  ratio of 4:3((480/3) * 4, (480/3) * 3), but a newer TV which is wider and has an aspect ratio of 16:9, it can have around 
  854 X 480 pixels in the screen resolution.
  
  Now we can talk about 720, 1080 and 2160(4K).  The newer TV's are wider and have an aspect ratio of 16x9, which means the
  amount of pixels a TV outputs in 720 would be ((720/9)*16, (720/9) * 9), which = 1280 x 720, and a TV/device that ouputs
  resolution at 1080, would have 1920 x 1080 pixels, and a TV/device that can output video at 4K(2160) would have 
  3840 x 2160 pixels.

   <h2>What is HDR?</h2>
   
<p>
  High Dynamic Range(HDR) is a new type of technology that many TV's are equipped with.  It basically means colors are more
  vibrant, the contrast is better, you can see darker blacks, and you can see brighter whites.  In the past many TV's had 
  issues with contrast, and specifically darker scenes in a movie were hard to see.  The range of colors is greater if a TV
  is equipped with HDR, and as a result your TV is able to output a more natural and real life picture on the screen.  Think 
  about this, there is the color red but how many different shades of red are there?  A TV equipped with HDR allows it to
  ouput many more different shades of colors/blacks/whites then traditional TV's.

    <h2>What is Ultra HD? What is Ultra HD Premium?</h2>
<p>
  Ultra HD is basically a set of a features and performance standards that allows a TV to provide a Ultra High Definition
  entertainment experience.  Years ago, many technology, entertainment, and electronic companies got together and created the
  Ultra High Definition Alliance(UHDA).  This alliance created this standard and devices that met this standard are allowed to
  use the Ultra HD Premimum logo when selling their TV's/devices.  Ultra HD started coming out around the same time as 4K, and
  many manufacturers primarily focused only on 4K resolution.  TV resolution is not the only feature important for the best
  possible picture.  Devices that are stamped with the Ultra HD Premium logo means they include HDR and have a wide color
  spectrum.

  <h2>How to get a 4K picture?</h2>
<p>
  Just because you bought your 4K TV doesn't mean your watching 4K, have you noticed that the picture in the store was much
  better then the picture you are currently getting?  There are many factors to consider in order to make sure you are
  getting a 4K picture.  Most cable/satellite providers do not output their channels in 4K and if they have a channel in 4K
  it may only be one channel or two at the most.  Currently Amazon Prime only has a handful of movies in 4K, Netflix actually
  has around 100 titles in 4K although most of them are Netflix originals, and many other websites/apps that offer streaming
  services may not offer 4K at all.  You can also try to download a 4K movie, but just because it says 4K does not mean it 
  is truly 4K.  One way to tell if your downloaded movie is truly 4K is to look at the size of the file.  Standard definition,
  high definition, and 4K definition movies can vary from title to title depending on the bit rate that your device records in.
  The higher the bit rate the better quality video you will get and the bigger the file will be(<%= link_to "Click here for 4K File Size Information", file_size_path %>).  However, you can only send as
  many bits as the frame rate(FPS) of your device, or refresh rate(30hz, 60hz, 120hz) of your display.  Frame rate is the amount
  of frames your device is able to send per second, refresh rate is the amount of times your display can refresh the picture,
  and bit rate is the amount of data(bits) your device is able to send to your display.
  
  The device that is outputting the content on the display is equally as important as the FPS, bit rate, and refresh rate.  If
  your cable box is sending content in standard definition, then your display will only be able to output that content in 
  standard definition.  If you stream a 4K video from a website then you need to make sure that your internet package has around
