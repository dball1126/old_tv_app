  The numbers speak for themselves, but look at the difference between 480i and 480p.  Calculating the pixels for 480i is
  broken down into two different scans(fields), hence the reason why the pixels are added together.  This is strictly because
  of <%= link_to "Interlacing", i_vs_p_path %>.  Basically two fields of Interlacing equals one frame, and one frame of 
  Progressive scanning equals one frame. Progressive scanning calculates the pixels in a single frame, but Interlacing uses 
  the term fields since it uses two scans to calculate one frame.
