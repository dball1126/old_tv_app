<p>
    You must understand what 480p, 480i, 720p, 1080i, and 1080p is because 4K is basically 2160p.
  
  Devices that can output video in 480 or content that is recorded in 480 has 480 horizontal scan lines of resolution. 
  The difference between 480p and 480i has to do with <%= link_to "Interlaced(i) vs Progressive(p)", i_vs_p_path %>
  scanning. Generally Progressive scanning will produce a better picture and is recommended over Interlaced scanning.
  The numbers 480, 720, and 1080 are referring to the scan lines of resolution, this generally means the higher the 
  number the higher the resolution.  Older CRT TV's and a picture considered standard definition is normally 480P/i or
  lower, and it normally has an aspect ratio of 4:3(square picture just like the older TV's). A TV(480P) can have 
  640(width) x 480(length) pixels on a screen with an aspect ratio of 4:3((480/3) * 4, (480/3) * 3), but a TV(480p) with
  an aspect ratio of 16:9, can have around 854 X 480 pixels in screen resolution. A TV(480i) has the same amount of pixels
  as 480p, but it uses Interlaced scanning and the picture is not the same. Look at this <%= link_to "pixel chart",
  pixel_chart_path %> for a complete breakdown in pixel difference between the different display resolutions.
  
  Now we can talk about 720p, 1080p and 2160p(4K).  The newer TV's are wider and have an aspect ratio of 16:9, which means
  the amount of pixels a TV outputs in 720 would be ((720/9)*16, (720/9) * 9), which = 1280 x 720, and a TV/device that
  ouputs resolution at 1080p, would have 1920 x 1080 pixels, and a TV/device that can output video at 4K(2160) would have 
  3840 x 2160 pixels.
